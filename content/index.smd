Hello, I'm Hayden! I'm a firmware and electrical engineer by trade and a hobbyist in my free time.
I currently reside in Seattle, Washington where I work as Lead Firmware Engineer at Terra Kaffe. Recently I've been
contributing to the [Zig Programming Language](https://ziglang.org/) and am part of the
[Zig Embedded Group](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup). Come check out what I've been up to on Github,
or take a look at my blog below!
