## General Design Notes

These were the first two woodworking projects I ever completed. The cutting board is made out of
maple on the interior, and walnut on the border. It is constructed so that the end grain of the wood is the cutting
surface, which is generally better for kitchen knives. It is sealed and finished with food grade mineral oil,
and beeswax.

The knife covers were made out of the leftover walnut I had from the cutting board. I first used a table saw to make
sheets of walnut about 1/8" thick. The covers are constructed with three 1/8" thick sheets glued together. The middle
sheet has a gap cut out of it to accommodate the knife. I did this by tracing my knives onto the middle sheet, and then
using a band saw to route out the appropriate space. I glued sheets together one at a time, using the band saw after
each glue-up to take off excess material. In order to keep the knives tightly in the cover, I added a snap-on leather
strap. One end of the snap is mounted on either side of the cover, and the other to a strip of leather. To finish the
covers I hand sanded them, and then sealed with shellac.
